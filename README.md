# JavaScript-Project- Algorithm Visualization

This project will take common algorithms and represent them visually in order to promote a better understanding of these 
abstract ideas and facilitate the recognition of patterns in data.

## MVP

1. Random dot distribution: solved and visualized using multiple algorithms (Mitchel's best candidate, uniform random sampling, 
Poisson-disc)

2. Graphs comparing the algorithms to one another.

3.Maze creation visualization: depth first, breadth first, random traversal, Wilson's, randomized Prim)

4. Sorting algorithm visualizations: mergesort, quicksort, fisher-yates

5. Matrix diagrams showing algorithm biases that are not as visible to the human eye

6. ReadMe


## Technologies

I will build this project using vanilla JavaScript, CSS and D3.
